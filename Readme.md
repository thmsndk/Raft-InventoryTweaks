# Features
- Replace broken items in your hotbar with a spare from your inventory
- Show the total amount of an item across all storages on hover

# Default Raft Features
- right click takes 1 item
- middle click splits stack in half
- scrollwheel changes amount

# TODO
- move multiple items by holding shift and moving over items?
- Sort inventory on middle click? 
- Z sorts your inventory (currently inventory sorting adds this feature)
- Auto craft broken items if you have the resources?
- refill food items?
- hold Q with drag and drop items on over
- ctrl + q drop all items of same type
- click on research item to put in required research item

# Ideas
probably belongs in another mod

- Raft Inventory Count / Ledger (could perhaps do something like islanditems?)
- Render a sprite above / in front of a container like the island loot mod? - perhaps when you focus it (OnRayed? showing contents
- An Item Sign that renders what is inside a storage chest?
- All In One inventory that opens by default when you press tab? - should render all storages on your raft. should probably be a new mod
